## Basics

* An algorithm is either:
     + any well defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values as output. OR
     + a tool for solving a well-specified computational problem
* An instance problem consists of the input (satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem statement) needed to compute a solution to the problem. Example: {* * * * is an instance of the sorting problem
* An algorithm is said to be correct, if for every input instance it halts with the correct output.
* Incorrect algorithms can be useful, if their error rate is controlled.

## Applications of algorithms

* The human genome project made great progress toward finding all genes in human DNA by sorting and analyzing information with help of algorithms.
* Internet search engines, protocols make extensive use of algorithms.
* Personal privacy in e-commerce is achieved by numerical algorithms and number theory.
* In allocating resources beneficially for manufacturing and commercial enterprises.

## Data structures

* A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

## Other stuff

* N-P complete problems: Till date, no one knows whether or not efficient algorithms exist to these type of problems and so in real world an approximate solution is acceptable. Example: The travelling salesman problem
* Parallelism: Increasing efficiency of algorithms by taking advantage of multi-threaded algorithms which use multiple cores of CPU.

## Efficiency

* Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efficiency.

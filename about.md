Your doubts are true. Indeed I am insane!

First reason for your doubt is certainly the title -- *Damn Learning.* This title appeared from thin air. On morning I came to know that I loved to learn. Then I though some more to learn that I loved the word **damn** even more. So I strung them together to make up *Learning damn* but it nonsensical. So I swapped the words to arrive at *Damn Learning.* It sounded better.

Since you're an acute observer, I am sure you have seen something peculiar in the footer. It reads Â© 2013 Stupendous Ma.. whoa! Stupendous Man? Who the hell is he? Or if you know him already, then why is his name hanging in my blog's footer? 

They are all important questions to ask. I am happy to answer. If you do not know who stupendous man is, I can tell you. Stupendous man is, obviously as you've guessed already, a superhero. This you would have interpreted from the names of other famous but uncool super heroes you know of. The names Batman, Superman, Spiderman, etc come to my mind. Stupendous Man is better because he appears not in TV. He's an integral part of the famous comic strip *Calvin and Hobbes*. He hasn't made ityet to hollywood, for which you should thank his creator Bill waterson who decided not to commercialize his comic.

Here's how Stupendous Man looks like, just in case:
